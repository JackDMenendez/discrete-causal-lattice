"""
TickScheduler.py
The Combinatorial Clock Scheduler.

Each CausalSession carries its own independent tick counter.
The TickScheduler maintains the collection of all active session
tick counters and determines their processing order.

The shuffling of tick counters is the mechanism by which:
  - Relativity of simultaneity is modeled
  - The observer-as-clock is formalized
  - Particle decay becomes timing-dependent
  - Clock density encodes gravity
