PhaseRotor.py
The U(1) Internal Clock: the particle's phase state keeper.

The PhaseRotor is the internal oscillator of a CausalSession.
Its frequency omega is the particle's instruction overhead -- rest mass.
Its current phase encodes the particle's internal time coordinate.

A high-frequency rotor (heavy particle) has high phase stability:
it resists redirection (inertia). A low-frequency rotor (light particle)
is easily scattered by minor potential gradients.

DOCUMENTATION CONVENTION:
  Every non-trivial line of physics code should say what it IS in the theory,
  not just what it does in the program.  Name the mathematical object, cite
  the paper equation where one exists, and state the correspondence explicitly:
  "this IS X" when exact, "this approximates X" in the continuum limit.
  The structure factor comment in CausalSession._kinetic_hop is the template.
